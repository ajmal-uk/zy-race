        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>My name is <strong>Ajmal U K</strong>, and I am the founder of
                <strong>UTHAKKAN</strong>. I come from Kannur, a small coastal town in Kerala, India. I don't have a
                massive team, millions in VC funding, or a fancy office in Silicon Valley. What I have is a laptop,
                an internet connection, and an obsession with code.</p>

            <h2>The "Zero Budget" Philosophy</h2>

            <p>In the world of <strong>indie game development</strong>, constraints are your best friend.
                When I decided to build ZyRace, I set one rule:
                <strong>It must be free to build and free to play.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>This philosophy forced me to innovate. Instead of buying expensive assets, I learned to generate
                textures procedurally. Instead of paying for heavy server hosting, I optimized the netcode to run
                efficiently on lightweight instances. This journey taught me that
                <strong>resourcefulness matters more than resources</strong>.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "You don't need permission to build something great. You just need to start typing."
            </div>

            <h2>The Tech Stack: Why Python & Vanilla JS?</h2>

            <p>Many developers asked why I didn't use Unity or Unreal Engine. The answer is simple:
                <strong>Control.</strong></p>

            <p>By building the engine from scratch using <strong>Python (Flask)</strong> for the backend and
                <strong>Vanilla JavaScript</strong> for the frontend, I gained a deep understanding of every byte that
                goes over the wire. This allows ZyRace to load in under 2 seconds on 3G networks—something bloated game
                engines struggle to achieve.</p>

            <h2>Late Nights in Kannur</h2>

            <p>The journey wasn't easy. There were nights when the physics engine would break, sending cars flying into
                the stratosphere (a bug we later turned into a "feature"). There were times managing college studies
                alongside full-stack development felt impossible.</p>

            <p>But then, the first user review came in: <em>"This game runs so smoothly on my old phone. Thank you."</em>
                That one sentence made every sleepless night worth it.</p>

            <h2>The Vision of UTHAKKAN</h2>

            <p><strong>UTHAKKAN</strong> is more than just a company name; it's a statement. It stands for independent
                thinking and resilient building. Moving forward, my goal is to expand UTHAKKAN into a hub for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Open Source Tools:</strong> Releasing the utilities I built for ZyRace to the community.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Integration:</strong> Using LLMs to create dynamic game narratives.</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Helping aspiring developers in India build world-class software from their bedrooms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Join the Adventure</h2>

            <p>ZyRace is just the start. If you're a developer, a gamer, or a dreamer, I invite you to follow this
                journey. Let's build the future of the web, one line of code at a time.</p>
