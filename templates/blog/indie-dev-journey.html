            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>Hi everyone! I'm <strong>Ajmal U K</strong>, the developer behind ZyRace. I run a small indie studio
                    called <strong>UTHAKKAN</strong> from the beautiful coastal town of Kannur in Kerala, India.</p>

                <h2>The Spark</h2>
                <p>I've always been fascinated by how things work. Whether it was taking apart toy cars as a kid or
                    debugging complex algorithms now, the curiosity has always been there. ZyRace started as a weekend
                    project. I wanted to see if I could build a car game that ran entirely in the browser without
                    needing heavy downloads.</p>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    "The best games aren't always the ones with the biggest budgets. They're the ones made with the most
                    heart."
                </div>

                <h2>The Challenges of Solo Dev</h2>
                <p>Being a solo developer means wearing many hats. One minute I'm the lead engineer fixing a physics
                    bug, the next I'm the UI designer picking color palettes, and then I'm the marketing team writing
                    these blog posts!</p>
                <p>It's exhausting, but incredibly fulfilling. Every pixel on the screen is a decision I made. Every
                    feature is something I built because I thought it would be fun.</p>

                <h2>Why "UTHAKKAN"?</h2>
                <p>UTHAKKAN represents my identity and my roots. It's a reminder to stay grounded while aiming high.
                    Through UTHAKKAN, I aim to build not just games, but useful tools like resume builders and
                    productivity apps that help people in their daily lives.</p>

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                <p>ZyRace is just the beginning. I have plans for more tracks, more cars, and maybe even a multiplayer
                    mode. But beyond that, I want to keep learning and sharing my journey with you all.</p>

                <p>Thank you for playing, for reading, and for being part of this adventure.</p>
