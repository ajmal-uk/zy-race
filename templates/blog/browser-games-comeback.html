            <p>
                For a long time, "browser games" meant simple Flash animations or clunky HTML5 experiments.
                But in 2025, that narrative has flipped. Browser gaming is entering a new golden age,
                driven by powerful technologies like <strong>WebGL</strong> and <strong>WebAssembly (Wasm)</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>The End of "Download and Install"</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest friction in gaming is the setup. Steam updates, massive downloads,
                disk space management—it's a hassle. Browser games offer <strong>zero-friction access</strong>.
                You send a link, your friend clicks it, and you're playing together in seconds.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The web is the only platform where distribution is instant."
            </div>

            <h2>WebGL: GPU Power to the People</h2>
            <p>
                ZyRace uses pure JavaScript and Canvas for maximum compatibility, but the next generation of
                web games is pushing 3D limits. WebGL allows the browser to talk directly to your Graphics Card.
                This means:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Dynamic lighting and shadows</li>
                <li>Complex particle systems (smoke, fire, rain)</li>
                <li>Post-processing effects like bloom and motion blur</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>WebAssembly: Near-Native Speed</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript is fast, but C++ is faster. With WebAssembly, developers can compile
                high-performance C++, Rust, or Go code into a binary format that runs in the browser at
                near-native speed. This unlocks:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Physics engines that can handle thousands of rigid bodies</li>
                <li>AI logic that doesn't stutter the framerate</li>
                <li>Porting of classic AAA titles to the web</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>ZyRace's Role</h2>
            <p>
                We built ZyRace to prove a point: You don't need a heavy engine to have fun.
                By optimizing for the lowest common denominator, we ensure that millions of students,
                office workers, and casual gamers can enjoy a premium racing experience without needing a gaming PC.
            </p>

            <h2>The Future is URL-based</h2>
            <p>
                As 5G becomes standard and browser engines get faster, the line between “native app” and
                “web app” will vanish. We are just getting started.
            </p>
